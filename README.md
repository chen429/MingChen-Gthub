GitHub is mostly used for code.

In addition to source code, GitHub supports the following formats and features:

Issue tracking (including feature requests) with labels, milestones, assignees and a search engine
Wikis
Pull requests with code review and comments
Commits history
Graphs: pulse, contributors, commits, code frequency, punch card, network, members
Integrations Directory

Email notifications
Option to subscribe someone to notifications by @ mentioning them.

GitHub Pages: small websites can be hosted from public repositories on GitHub. 

Visualization of geospatial data
